I'm a student in IT Engineering, at Politecnico di Bari (Ba, Italy). <p> 

I love informatics, the people I know told me I was born with a PC, maybe because my family is in IT too. I enjoy programming, both high level software and thing that can move and shape the world around me. <p>
##### What's informatics and technology for you?
It's basically what allows me to help people live a lazier life, and solving everyday problems in such a way that minimal effort should be made by my target users.
##### What are you interested in at the moment?
Multithreaded programming, and I'd like to study Multi-Agent systems and Bio-Informatics.
##### One thing you'd like to work on?
Robotic swarm driven by bio-inspired AI. For example, [TERMES project at SSRG, Harvard](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/ssr/projects/cons/termes.html)
