I enjoy programming, both high level software and thing that can move and shape the world around me. <p>\r\n##### What's informatics and technology for you?\r\nIt's basically what allows me to help people live a lazier life, and solving everyday problems in such a way that minimal effort should be made by my target users.\r\n##### What are you interested in at the moment?\r\nMultithreaded programming, and I'd like to study Multi-Agent systems and Bio-Informatics.\r\n##### One thing you'd like to work on?\r\nRobotic swarm driven by bio-inspired AI. For example, [TERMES project at SSRG, Harvard](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/ssr/projects/cons/termes.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
